This project will be about building a basic recipe website, which will consist of a main index page with links to a few recipes.

The goal of this project is to get familiar with Git and GitHub in addition to using the skills and knowledge about HTML i gained by following the "The Odin Project" curriculum.

CSS and JS are not my priority as of now for this project, only the HTML component of this recipe website.
